# Validation, Authentication and Authorization with Libraries

In the previous excerpt with discussed validation, authentication and authorization. We mentioned that validation is a mechanism to ensure that data passed to the api is in a accepted format. Authentication is verifying the legitimacy of a user's claim and authorization is what a user can and cannot do. We went ahead and implemented these concepts. In this excerpts we are going to look at how to use libraries/packages for validation and auth.

## Content

-   Separation of concerns
-   Validation with Joi
-   Auth with JSON Web Tokens

## Separation of concerns

We started to section or move some of our code into different files. We have the data we are manipulating, in the `data.js` file, we have the validations in `validations.js` and so on. This process can get complicated and out of hand easily. So don't push it. It is a simple application we are building.

As usual, we are building on top of the previous codebase which can be found [on github](https://github.com/Otumian-empire/otumian-blogging-articles/tree/main/expense-tracker-api-articles/02-basic-crud-api-with-validation-and-auth/expense-tracker-simple-api) and read more on it on [Validation, Authentication and Authorization](https://dev.to/otumianempire/validation-authentication-and-authorization-5cag).

The api we are building is that titled expense tracker. We have users and their expenses. So we are dealing with two entities. As the project grows and the content of the `index.js` grows, we have to pull certain codes out or group them to be precise. This is not a must, we can write all our code in one files and it will work fine. There are advantages and disadvantages to it, however, it is better to know when to group your functionalities.

In the `index.js`, which serves as the entry point into out application, there are:

-   application conficurations, which will include top level middlewares, etc
-   routes for expenses
-   routes for users
-   there are some snippet we can have as functions and some literals as constants
-   app, listen on port 3000 (server runing here), may do database connections when the server starts, etc

Consider, `app.SOME_METHOD(route, request handlers)` `SOME_METHOD` is the http method, is the definition of how routes are passed with some middlewares and the request handlers are passed or handled. We have `app.get("/expenditures", (req, res) => {...})` where `"/expenditures"` is the routes and `(req, res) => {...}` is a request handler. We can separate the request handler as a standalone function. We already know how to create functions (and even async functions). When we create a function outof `(req, res) => {...}`, we can pass it as, ``app.get("/expenditures", functionName)`. That is it. We can choose to keep the routes and the request handlers (controllers) in the same file or separate them.

We can have a file, just because our project is small else we would use folders, for the list above.

### Taking actions

These are some of the changes we can do (follow along):

-   create a file for `user` and `expenditures` endpoints. So we'd have `users.js` and `expenditures.js`.
    -   move the _login_ and _sign up_ endpoints into `users.js`
    -   move CRUD expenditure into `expenditures.js`
    -   there are imports that we have to take care of such as the validation functions, the data consumed and others.
    -   remove unused imports from the `index.js`
-   import and create router from express. We can name this route `app` so that it will be easier for to maintain the current implementation as is. Or we can give it a custom name and replace `app` in the custom name. I will keep to `app` and export it at the very bottom of `users.js` and `expenditures.js`.

    ```js
    // import at the very top
    const app = require("express").Router();

    // there other code

    // very bottom
    module.exports = app;
    ```

-   in `users.js`, we have to import the validation functions and also `crypto` for creating the user id (uuid). In all we will have an import like this:

    ```js
    const app = require("express").Router();
    const crypto = require("crypto");
    let { users } = require("./data");
    const { isValidEmail, isValidPassword } = require("./validations");

    // the endpoints below

    // the export
    ```

-   in `expenditures.js`

    ```js
    const app = require("express").Router();
    let { users, expenditures } = require("./data");
    const {
        isValidName,
        isValidAmount,
        isValidDate,
    } = require("./validations");
    // the endpoints below

    // the export
    ```

-   at this point, the `index.js` file should look more or less

    ```js
    // import the express lib
    const express = require("express");

    // import lib for generating uuid
    const crypto = require("crypto");

    // data source imports
    let { expenditures, users } = require("./data");
    const { isValidEmail, isValidPassword } = require("./validations");

    // validation

    // create an express application
    const app = express();

    // parse request body as json
    app.use(express.json());

    // create a server that listens to requests on port 3000
    app.listen(3000, () =>
        console.log(`Api running on ${"http://localhost:3000"}`)
    );
    ```

-   we have to clean it since some of these imports are unused and we will import the routers we exported from `users.js` and `expenditures.js`.

    ```js
    // import the express lib
    const express = require("express");

    // import the routers exported from users and expenditures
    const userEndpoints = require("./users");
    const expendituresEndpoints = require("./expenditures");

    // create an express application
    const app = express();

    // parse request body as json
    app.use(express.json());

    // register routers
    app.use(userEndpoints);
    app.use(expendituresEndpoints);

    // create a server that listens to requests on port 3000
    app.listen(3000, () =>
        console.log(`Api running on ${"http://localhost:3000"}`)
    );
    ```

-   the sign up and login works fine, you should test them too
-   we can create a new user (copy the newly created user's log into the data file)
-   update the http request for expenditures endpoints by adding `Authorization` to each request
-   the code for authorizing the user to browse their expenditures is only found in the `list expenditures` endpoint. Let's "copy" and "paste" it... ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ (that is what programmers do but software engineers will create a reusable block of code from it, isn't that right?)
-   let's a function for authorize in a file called `auth.js`. This function will take in the auth token and a boolean indicating if the token is authorized and an object which can be used to identify the user, `{ userId, email }`.
-   we want to change

    ```js
    // extra auth token from headers
    const authorization = req.headers.authorization;
    if (!authorization) {
        return res.status(200).json({
            success: false,
            message: "Unathorized, please login",
        });
    }

    // decode auth token
    const decodeToken = Buffer.from(authorization, "base64").toString();

    // parse the decode token into the email and userId
    const [email, userId] = decodeToken.split(":");

    // now we can fetch user with email and userId
    const isAuthenticUser = users.find(
        (user) => user.email === email && user.id === userId
    );

    if (!isAuthenticUser) {
        return res.status(200).json({
            success: false,
            message: "Unathorized, please login",
        });
    }
    ```

-   into

    ```js
    // auth.js;

    const { users } = require("./data");

    // pass the req.headers.authorization as argument
    function authorize(authToken) {
        const response = {
            isAuthorized: false,
            userId: "",
            email: "",
        };

        if (!authToken) {
            return response;
        }

        // decode auth token
        const decodeToken = Buffer.from(authToken, "base64").toString();

        // parse the decode token into the email and userId
        const [email, userId] = decodeToken.split(":");

        // now we can fetch user with email and userId
        const isAuthenticUser = users.find(
            (user) => user.email === email && user.id === userId
        );

        if (!isAuthenticUser) {
            return response;
        }

        // here the token is valid
        response.isAuthorized = true;
        response.email = email;
        response.userId = userId;

        return response;
    }

    module.exports = { authorize };
    ```

-   let's add this guard into each expenditures endpoint..

    ```js
    // we have to import the authorize function from auth.js

    // extra auth token from headers
    const authReponse = authorize(req.headers.authorization);
    if (!authReponse.isAuthorized) {
        return res.status(200).json({
            success: false,
            message: "Unathorized, please login",
        });
    }

    // parse the auth user id
    const { userId } = authReponse;
    ```

    > Try running some of these endpoints... we have passed the auth token and we have a guard in place. Don't believe everything I say ðŸ™ˆ

    > back to "copy and paste"... We will learn about middlewares later and update our to use middleware.

-   Running `list expenditures` is successful
-   we have to update `read expenditure` to account for the `userId` from the `auth response` and also the resourse ID is not a number but a uuid. we will remove the checking if the `id` is a number and use `expenditures.find` (or filter if you want to but handle the rest) instead of `expenditures[id]`

    ```js
    // read expenditure
    app.get("/expenditures/:id", (req, res) => {
        // extra auth token from headers
        const authReponse = authorize(req.headers.authorization);
        if (!authReponse.isAuthorized) {
            return res.status(200).json({
                success: false,
                message: "Unathorized, please login",
            });
        }

        // parse the auth user id
        const { userId } = authReponse;

        // get the id of the request resource from the params
        const id = req.params.id;

        const row = expenditures.find(
            (row) => row.userId === userId && row.id === id
        );
        if (!row) {
            // what status code do this should be passed here? 404 not not found? why??
            return res.status(200).json({
                success: false,
                message: `Resource with ID, '${id}' not found`,
            });
        }

        return res.status(200).json({
            success: true,
            data: row,
        });
    });
    ```

-   When we run create, the record is created however is not assigned to the user who created it. Did you notice that? Create a very small request to fetch all expenditures or `console.log` the `expenditures` variable you are fetching the user's expenditures. This was because we added the `authorize`, from which we got `userId` but we didn't use it. All we have to do is add the `userId` to the expense record and generate a uuid (sample code is in the `users.js`, _sign up_).

```js
// generate uuid unique to this expense
const uuid = crypto.randomUUID();

// insert the new record
expenditures.push({
    id: uuid,
    userId,
    name: payload.name,
    amount: payload.amount,
    date: payload.date,
});
```

-   for `update expenditure`:

    -   to update the expenditure, we can find the index of this (expenditure of interest) and if we get the _index_, we can update it. There is the _map_ and match approach too where we _map_ the `expenditures` and match the resource id to a record and update that record, reassign the `expenditures` with the newly created array.
    -   remove the number checking for resource ID (did similar in `read expenditure`)
    -   replace `const row = expenditures[id];` with `const rowIndex = expenditures.findIndex(...)` accounting for the `userId`. We will use this `rowIndex` to assign value to `row` and also use it to _index_ the row we wanted updated from the `expenditures`.
    -   we will replace, `expenditures[id].PROPERTY = PROPERTY ?? row.PROPERTY;` with `expenditures[rowIndex].PROPERTY = PROPERTY ?? row.PROPERTY;
    -   update the `http` request to use the `uuid` instead of a number.

    ```js
    // update expenditure
    app.put("/expenditures/:id", (req, res) => {
        // extra auth token from headers
        const authReponse = authorize(req.headers.authorization);
        if (!authReponse.isAuthorized) {
            return res.status(200).json({
                success: false,
                message: "Unathorized, please login",
            });
        }

        // parse the auth user id
        const { userId } = authReponse;

        // get the id of the request resource from the params
        const id = Number(req.params.id);

        // if the record is not found, rowIndex becomes -1
        const rowIndex = expenditures.findIndex(
            (row) => row.userId === userId && row,
            id === id
        );
        if (rowIndex === -1) {
            // what status code do this should be passed here? 404 not not found? why??
            return res.status(200).json({
                success: false,
                message: `Resource with ID, '${id}' not found`,
            });
        }

        const row = expenditures[rowIndex];

        // we have to validate the name, maybe, there name must have some number of characters
        // we have to make sure that amount is actually a number
        // we have to also make sure that date is of the format, yyyy-MM-dd
        const { name, amount, date } = req.body;

        if (!name || !amount || !date) {
            return res.status(200).json({
                success: false,
                message: "name, amount and date for expense are required",
            });
        }

        // validate name if it is passed
        if (name && !isValidName(name)) {
            return res.status(200).json({
                success: false,
                message: "Name is invalid",
            });
        }

        // validate amount if it is passed
        if (amount && !isValidAmount(amount)) {
            return res.status(200).json({
                success: false,
                message: "Amount is invalid",
            });
        }

        // validate date if it is passed
        if (date && !isValidDate(date)) {
            return res.status(200).json({
                success: false,
                message: "Expense date is invalid",
            });
        }

        expenditures[rowIndex].name = name ?? row.name;
        expenditures[rowIndex].amount = amount ?? row.amount;
        expenditures[rowIndex].date = date ?? row.date;

        // there was a time a saw a 204 status - No content
        // since there was no data to return however we'll return the usual
        return res.status(200).json({
            success: true,
            message: "expenditure updated successfully",
        });
    });
    ```

-   for `delete expenditure`:
    -   most of the changes to be done is similar to the update
    -   remove the number checking for the resource ID
    -   find the `rowIndex`, if it is `-1` then there is no row found
    -   pass the `rowIndex` inplace of `id` in `expenditures = expenditures.filter((_, index) => index !== id);`
    -   Give it a try

At this point, we have :

-   rewritten mmost parts of this api
-   separated the endpoints into their various files
-   fixed file paths and imports and exports
-   fixed the resource ID validations
-   fixed or patched the auth mechanism
-   fixed managing resources, accounting for `userId`

> Make sure you have a working api by testing (hitting) each endpoint and that you get the appropriate response. Use console logs if you have to, read the error logs displayed in the console.

## Validation

I want to point out that even though we wrote most of our validations, we can use a library for that. As we have discussed some time ago, a library is a piece of code that does something specific and can be reused, bundled as one (as in whatever functionalities the library provides). Usually libraries are well versioned, maintained and tested. Using a library removes some sort of responsibility in maintaining some functionality. This would save time and reduce the chunks of code "we" write. There also downsides to this. Some libraries maybe outdated and be vulnerable to some attacks as a result of it not been maintained and upto date with the current (nodejs) runtime. As such be careful with using third party libraries.

For validation libraries, there are several and the one we will use today is [Joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi). At the time of writing this excerpt, the current version was [17.13.3](https://joi.dev/api/?v=17.13.3). Spend sometime on this [this](https://joi.dev/api/?v=17.13.3#general-usage) page just to see how to use [Joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi).

> By the way, run, `npm i joi`, to install Joi

### Replicating validations.js

> This is something we'd be doing on the side then integrate later.

From the generaal usage [page](https://joi.dev/api/?v=17.13.3#general-usage), validation with Joi is done in two simple steps.

-   Create a schema
-   Use the schema to validate your data
-   Handle the response, error and value. Error is the data failed the validation criteria. Value is the validated data (passed as argument).

> We can validate the literal types: number, string, bool, and an array and an object as well.

### Validate Sign up and Login Credentials

There is no difference between the _sigu up_ validation and _log in_ validation, both has _email_ and _password_.

> Just to be clear, create a new file for the validation with _Joi_. (`joi_validations.js`)
> We will be referencing the old validations rewritten

We want to create a _schema_ that has an _email_ and _password_ properties.

```js
const authValidationSchema = Joi.object().keys({
    email: Joi.string().email().required(),
    password: Joi.string().min(6).required(),
});
```

Assuming we have, this below, as credentials

```js
const credentials = {
    email: "johndoe1@gmail.com",
    password: "JohnPwd12_",
};
```

Then we can validate the credentials as follows:

```js
const { error, value } = authValidationSchema.validate(credentials);

console.log({ error, value });

/* console log
{
  error: undefined,
  value: { email: 'johndoe1@gmail.com', password: 'JohnPwd12_' }
}
*/
```

Let's say we passed, intentionally for demo purposes, invalid credentials:

```js
const inValidCredentials = {
    email: "johndoe1gmail.com",
    password: "John",
};
```

The `schema.validate` method, takes a argument of objects, `options`. The second argument is nullable or rather has some default values and among these, there are:

-   `abortEarly`: By default is `true`. When `true`, stops validation on the first error, otherwise returns all the errors found. So if the email was invalid, it will stop the validation, ignoring the password validation, and return the validation response.
-   `allowUnknown`: By default is `false`. When `true`, allows object to contain unknown keys which are ignored. Let's say we are expecting _email_ and _password_ but user is passing _ide_ as part of the request, we can ignore this noise by setting `allowUnknown` to `true`.
-   `convert`: by default is `true`. When `true`, attempts to cast values to the required types (e.g. a string to a number).

> You really have to think about these because of these options can have an effect on the user interface and the user experience

> Aborting early means, I will have one error field and UI will have just one error component (div or something) else UI would either have to join the list of error messages together and display as one or have differnt alerts for each error. Depending on what decision is made, this will affect the User experience.

```js
const invalidResult = authValidationSchema.validate(inValidCredentials, {
    abortEarly: false,
});

console.log(invalidResult.value);
// console log
// { email: 'johndoe1gmail.com', password: 'John' }

console.log(invalidResult.error);

/* console log
[Error [ValidationError]: "email" must be a valid email. "password" length must be at least 6 characters long] {
  _original: { email: 'johndoe1gmail.com', password: 'John' },
  details: [
    {
      message: '"email" must be a valid email',
      path: [Array],
      type: 'string.email',
      context: [Object]
    },
    {
      message: '"password" length must be at least 6 characters long',
      path: [Array],
      type: 'string.min',
      context: [Object]
    }
  ]
}
*/
```

We can write a custom validation method.

This is what we have for the previous password validation.

```js
function isValidPassword(password) {
    if (!password || !isString(password) || password.length < 6) {
        return false;
    }

    const UPPER_CASE = LETTERS.map((char) => char.toUpperCase());
    if (!hasAnyOf(password, UPPER_CASE)) {
        return false;
    }

    if (!hasAnyOf(password, NUMBERS)) {
        return false;
    }

    return hasAnyOf(password, SPECIAL_SYMBOLS);
}
```

We can make this function a method to be used in the current validation schema by passing it a method to the `custom` method.

> the reference to constants are infered (we already have them, ðŸ™ˆ copy them over or export them from `validations.js`) and here we either return the value or throw an error when it is not valid.

We define a function that takes in the password (or the value to validate) and a second params, called, `helper`. (We will not use it but just pass it) - Read on helpers [here](https://joi.dev/api/?v=17.13.3#validation-helpers).

> So that there would be no naming comflits, the validation method will be named, `customPasswordValidation`

```js
const customPasswordValidation = (value, helpers) => {
    if (!value || typeof value !== "string") {
        throw new Error("Password invalid");
    }

    if (value.length < 6) {
        throw new Error("Password must be at least 6 characters");
    }

    const UPPER_CASE = LETTERS.map((char) => char.toUpperCase());
    if (!hasAnyOf(value, UPPER_CASE)) {
        throw new Error(
            "Password must inlcude at least one uppercase character"
        );
    }

    if (!hasAnyOf(value, NUMBERS)) {
        throw new Error("Password must inlcude at least one numeric character");
    }

    if (!hasAnyOf(value, SPECIAL_SYMBOLS)) {
        throw new Error(
            `Password must inlcude at least one of these special characters: [${SPECIAL_SYMBOLS.join(
                ","
            )}]`
        );
    }

    return value;
};
```

Let's try out this password validation.

```js
const passwords = ["", "John", "john123", "John123", "John123_"];

const customPasswordSchema = Joi.string().custom(
    customPasswordValidation,
    "custom password validation"
);

const errorList = passwords.reduce((errors, password) => {
    const { error } = customPasswordSchema.validate(password);

    errors.push({
        [password]:
            error?.details?.map((log) => log.message).join("and") ?? "No error",
    });

    return errors;
}, []);

console.log(errorList);
/* console log
[
    { "": '"value" is not allowed to be empty' },
    {
        John: '"value" failed custom validation because Password must be at least 6 characters',
    },
    {
        john123:
            '"value" failed custom validation because Password must inlcude at least one uppercase character',
    },
    {
        John123:
            '"value" failed custom validation because Password must inlcude at least one of these special characters: [$,_,-]',
    },
    { John123_: "No error" },
]; 
*/
```

At this point we can write some custom validation with Joi. Now we want to make use of this validation scheme where needed .i.e in the _sign up_ and _log in_. We can comment out or remove (you decide) the unwanted code from the `joi_validations.js` and export the `authValidationSchema` accounting for the `customPasswordValidation`.

```js
// joi_validations.js;
const Joi = require("joi");
const {
    hasAnyOf,
    LETTERS,
    NUMBERS,
    SPECIAL_SYMBOLS,
} = require("./validations");

const customPasswordValidation = (value, helpers) => {
    if (!value || typeof value !== "string") {
        throw new Error("Password invalid");
    }

    if (value.length < 6) {
        throw new Error("Password must be at least 6 characters");
    }

    const UPPER_CASE = LETTERS.map((char) => char.toUpperCase());
    if (!hasAnyOf(value, UPPER_CASE)) {
        throw new Error(
            "Password must inlcude at least one uppercase character"
        );
    }

    if (!hasAnyOf(value, NUMBERS)) {
        throw new Error("Password must inlcude at least one numeric character");
    }

    if (!hasAnyOf(value, SPECIAL_SYMBOLS)) {
        throw new Error(
            `Password must inlcude at least one of these special characters: [${SPECIAL_SYMBOLS.join(
                ","
            )}]`
        );
    }

    return value;
};

const authValidationSchema = Joi.object().keys({
    email: Joi.string().email().required(),
    password: Joi.string()
        .custom(customPasswordValidation, "custom password validation")
        .required(),
});

module.exports = { authValidationSchema };
```

In `user.js`, we will import `authValidationSchema` from `joi_validations.js` and replace:

```js
if (!isValidEmail(email)) {
    return res.status(200).json({
        success: false,
        message: "Invalid email",
    });
}

if (!isValidPassword(password)) {
    return res.status(200).json({
        success: false,
        message: "Invalid password",
    });
}
```

with

```js
const validationResponse = authValidationSchema.validate({
    email,
    password,
});
if (validationResponse.error) {
    return res.status(200).json({
        success: false,
        message: validationResponse.error.message,
        // message: validationResponse.error.details[0].message,
    });
}
```

We will do same for login and clean up unused imports.

### Validate expense

From the _http_ requests that we have we are to validate the expense on creation and update. During creations all the fields are required but optional during update.

```js
const createExpenseSchema = Joi.object().keys({
    name: Joi.string().min(10).max(255).required(),
    amount: Joi.number().positive().required(),
    date: Joi.date().iso().required(),
    // date: Joi.string().isoDate().required(),
});

const updateExpenseSchema = Joi.object().keys({
    name: Joi.string().min(10).max(255).optional(),
    amount: Joi.number().positive().optional(),
    date: Joi.date().iso().optional(),
    // date: Joi.string().isoDate().optional(),
});

module.exports = {
    authValidationSchema,
    createExpenseSchema,
    updateExpenseSchema,
};
```

In _create expenditures_, we will replace the individual validates with:

```js
...
// const { name, amount, date } = req.body
const payload = req.body;

const validationResponse = createExpenseSchema.validate(payload);
if (validationResponse.error) {
    return res.status(201).json({
        success: false,
        message: validationResponse.error.message,
    });
}
```

In update,

```js
...
 const { name, amount, date } = req.body;

    if (!name && !amount && !date) {
        return res.status(200).json({
            success: false,
            message: "name, amount or date for expense are required",
        });
    }

    const validationResponse = updateExpenseSchema.validate({
        name,
        amount,
        date,
    });
    if (validationResponse.error) {
        return res.status(200).json({
            success: false,
            message: validationResponse.error.message,
        });
    }
```
