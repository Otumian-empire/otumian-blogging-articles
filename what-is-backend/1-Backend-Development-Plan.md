# Backend Development Plan

If you are curious or new to programming maybe you'd like to give Nodejs a try.

I am planning on starting a new series on backend development with Nodejs, javascript and typescript. And these are the concepts I would cover. Not that detailed at the moment.

-   Introduction to Backend
    -   what is the backend
    -   what is an API
    -   what is rest API
    -   what is JSON
    -   request and response
-   Nodejs
-   JavaScript
    -   what is Javascript
    -   how to set up
    -   resources
    -   programming in Javascript
-   Node Packages and Yarn/npm
-   Typescript
-   Express
-   Joi
-   JSON Web Tokens
-   Database and SQL
-   Deploy application on render

We would discuss generally backend (APIs) and then set up Nodejs and vscode. We will discuss validation then use Joi and then create a middleware for validation. We will create a simple project, usually a todo app project but we will include a user, who will implement authentication using JSON web tokens before we will use basic authentications. We will add a database. We will use SQLite if we can not use mysql or Postgresql. We will use MongoDB (mongoose). Finally, we will deploy this simple application and deploy it on render.

PS: Let's see how far I can do this.
