# JavaScript Essentials: Part 4

Previously in [JavaScript Essentials: Part 3](https://dev.to/otumianempire/javascript-essentials-part-3-5cc0), we discussed quite a lot about objects and arrays and their methods for data manipulations. In this part, we will look at:

- Spreading and destructuring
- Operators
- Control structures (if statements, loops)
- Functions
- Callbacks, promises, async & await
- Next big thing
